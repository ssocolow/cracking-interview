## Important things to remember
- Interviews are hard!
- Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly - it's about answering them better than everyone else who is interviewing.

## Areas of Performance
- Analytical: how did you think about / work through the problem?
- Coding: Could you write a successful algorithm in code?
- Technical: Do you have a strong CS foundation of knowledge?
- Experience: Have you build interesting projects in the past?
- Culture: Can you communicate and work in their team?

## Tips
- Never let your coding skills atrophy
