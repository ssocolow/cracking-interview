Snowflake hackerrank - struggled for optimal solution of "how many pairs of numbers in this sorted array have a product less than or equal to a certain number?" but was getting close
Mathworks interview - struggled to get working solution for divying intern tasks so as to maximize the reward when intern1 has to take k tasks and intern2 takes all the other tasks.
